# Weather App with ReactJS
A simple weather app, which displays the current weather for an entered city.  
The weather data is fetched with the Weather API by [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api).  
This project is based on a tutorial by [Tyler Potts](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBBGM84ZOs7z5jpTQAaZ_Hg).

## What I have learned
- Connecting ReactJS to API
- Dynamic data with ReactJS
